        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who is ready for a career that I truly love. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in lots of different jobs. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a Realtor, a shoe salesman, a social media manger, and a YouTube parthernships manager. Despite the dozens of really interesting jobs I've had in the past, I've never felt satisfied and always had a curiosity for programming.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>By the end of the year, I want to be creating websites for clients. My goal is to have the knowledge, skills, and experience in the following areas to realize that dream:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>NodeJS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to create my own website dedicated to helping people play pen and paper games, like Dungeons & Dragons, online by helping manage their notes and information.</p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love hiking and being outdoors. Living in Georgia and the Southeast, the Appalachian Trail is my hiking mecca, although I dream about hiking in Patagonia and Yellowstone.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I love video games, specifically RPGs and hardcore MMOs!</p>
